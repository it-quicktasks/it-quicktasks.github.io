Hugo version tested: v0.49.2

Theme version used: https://github.com/icasimpan-oss/basics (HEAD: f5338db) as it has fixes not applied yet
                    to upstream https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/basics (HEAD: 93d2a49) that I need, as follow:
                    * #8 - css breaks when baseURL is not /
                    *    - updated title so it points to correct baseURL
