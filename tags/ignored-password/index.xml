      <description>Observed this in Mariadb 10.x versions. Despite being able to change password, it is still ignoring the password.
Non-root user not affected.
Explanation per https://mariadb.com/kb/en/authentication-from-mariadb-104/
 Using unix_socket means that if you are the system root user, you can login as root@locahost without a password. This technique was pioneered by Otto Kekäläinen in Debian MariaDB packages and has been successfully used in Debian since as early as MariaDB 10.0.
  It is based on a simple fact that asking the system root for a password adds no extra security — root has full access to all the data files and all process memory anyway.</description>
