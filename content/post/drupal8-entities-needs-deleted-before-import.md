The following was seen during configuration import (drush cim)
```
  The import failed due to the following reasons:                                                                                                                                
  Entities exist of type <em class="placeholder">Shortcut link</em> and <em class="placeholder">Shortcut set</em> <em class="placeholder">Default</em>. These entities need to   
  be deleted before importing. 
```
     
Fix by running this:
```
drush ev '\Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage("shortcut_set")->load("default")->delete();'
```
