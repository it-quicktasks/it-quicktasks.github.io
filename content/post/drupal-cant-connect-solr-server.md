Solr is already up and accessible from browser and within the drupal server but when connected through proper drupal admin settings, 
it says cannot connect to server.

Solution is to create solr core. See https://ismael.casimpan.com/quicktasks-solr/post/create-solr-core-with-config/ or https://ismael.casimpan.com/quicktasks-solr/post/creating-solr-core/ depending on your situation.
