Most probably caused by CSS/JS Aggreggation. Disable it by doing the following:

*Can edit settings.php* - add the following:
```
$config['system.performance']['css']['preprocess'] = FALSE;
$config['system.performance']['js']['preprocess'] = FALSE;
```

*In Drupal Admin*

-site-/admin/config/development/performance

Uncheck two checkboxes:
* Aggregate CSS files
* Aggregate JavaScript files
